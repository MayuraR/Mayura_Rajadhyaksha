                <p class="p1">With inimitable vocals that swept across the spectrum of pain, Chester Bennington became the voice of a generation as the lead singer of the multi-platinum, Grammy-winning hybrid rock group, Linkin Park.</p>
                <p class="p1">Conveying hurt with his vulnerable singing voice and rage with his guttural howl, Bennington was key to the band's sound, which made them a fixture at the top of the charts throughout the 2000s and 2010s, from 2000's diamond-selling debut Hybrid Theory to their sixth chart-topping effort, 2017's One More Light</p>
                <p class="p1"> In addition to his work with Linkin Park, Bennington was also the vocalist for '90s post-grunge outfit Grey Daze, his late-'00s side project Dead by Sunrise, and, briefly, one of his biggest musical influences, Stone Temple Pilots.</p>

After his parents divorced at age 11, he turned to drugs to deal with his pain.</p>
                <p class="p1">Despite his hardships, Bennington never forgot his childhood dream of becoming a rock star and, in 1993, he joined local band Grey Daze as the lead singer.He moved to Los Angeles to audition for a band then known as Xero, later known as Linkin Park.</p>
                <p class="p1">Despite multiple label rejections, the genre-pushing crew gaining a notable local fan base and eventually signed to Warner Bros. In 2000, they released their debut album, Hybrid Theory, which went on to become one of the biggest selling albums of all time. <br></p>

                <p class="p1">The band's visceral mix of rock, rap, and electronic resulted in a slew of hit singles like "In The End," "Numb," and "What I've Done," turning Linkin Park into one of the most popular mainstream rock groups in the early part of new millennium.</p>
                <p class="p1">Likewise, Bennington's often tortured vocals became one of the most distinctive in the rock scene. Six of the band's studio albums hit number one, and each of the first six earned at least platinum status</p>
